# üöó Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) Test Platform

This repository contains the code and documentation for a modular AMR test platform built to validate real-world navigation, localization, and safety features. The system integrates multiple sensors and compute elements including the **Jetson Nano**, **mmWave radar**, **IMU + GPS**, and **ESP32** microcontrollers to support advanced robotics development using **ROS 2** and **Micro-ROS**.
